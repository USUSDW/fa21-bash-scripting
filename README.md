# Bash and Shell Scripting Introduction

Scripting with your operating system shell is an incredibly powerful tool. One that can easily be integrated into ones workflow and ones software design and testing. Today's presentation will discuss shell scripting, and we will learn about Bash scripting together.

## What Is The Shell?

The shell is a program on your computer that performs select operating system tasks. You tell the shell *what* to do, the shell knows *how* to do it and dispatches the correct processes to do so. The shell is what processes the *commands you communicate to it* and produces the *result* of what you tell it to do. Think of your shell like an interpreter who knows how to communicate what the user asks it to the computer in such a way that the computer understands. The way you communicate with the shell follows a select syntax. Sounds like the shell knows how to understand a programming language, right?

## What Is Shell Scripting?

Shell scripting allows one to automate operating system tasks. Often times one finds themselves writing multiple shell commands in successsion to accomplish a large task. Shell scripting allows one to write these lists of commands to a file that can then be executed by your systems shell. For example, one can ask the shell to `cat` two files together, then take the output of that command, put it into a file, and then compare the differences between that file and another. We can take this process that may be 2 or 3 independent commands and execute this sequence of independent commands with a single command. 

Shell scripting is far more powerful than a simple *list* of commands. As noted above, the shell understands a whole *language*, one that is used in shell scripting. Many may be familiar with some of the simple syntax of the language; such as changing directories, executing external commands, and command output redirection. However, this language is *far* more advanced than may seem initially, and has whole control structures available like many other programming languages to take your shell scripting to the next level.
